System = As Au double-molecule system for Neda
LREAL = Auto
IALGO = 48
PREC = accurate ! uses a larger NGx and smaller ROPT; may want to raise ENCUT to ENMAX*1.3
ADDGRID = TRUE
ENCUT = {{encut}} eV  ! this value is 1.3 * ENMAX for C atoms
NELMIN = 8     !  do a minimum of four electronic steps
IBRION =  1    !  use RMM-DIIS algorithm for ions
ISMEAR = -5    !  Blochl correction to tetrahedron method
EDIFF = 0.000001
NPAR=1
