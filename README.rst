Chiminey
========

The Cloud and Cluster Computing Platform.

Introduction
============

The Chiminey system is a cloud-based scheduler for building scentific applications for use by scientists on a day-to-day basis for cloud-enabling existing long-running sequential and parallel applications.

Chiminey provides

* Definition, execution and monitoring of high-performance and cloud computing applications.

* A API framework that allows IT research engineers to collaborate with scientists to build and useful computation and analysis engines.

* Automatic generation of arbitrary parameter sweeps over variables that can be schduled on HPC clusers or across cloud IaaS nodes.

* Ability to wrap arbitrary legacy code applications (e.g. fortran), with minimum extra work.

* Advanced Fault tolerance system.

* Connectors for data transfer to and from remote data sources and remote execution platforms for both unix and cloud computation resources.

* Provides framework for metdata extraction and publishing to the MyTardis data curation system

* Provides APIs for both job submission and montoring but also redefinition of alternative user interfaces.


The Bioscience Data Platform
----------------------------

Chiminey is a key product of the BioScience Data Platform project: Tardis in the Cloud Project (see X), which is project beween Monash University and RMIT University, Victoria Australia funded by NeCTAR.  This project fosuses on bringing existing computational systems together in a way that allows scientists to seemslessly work with data from capture through to publication.
