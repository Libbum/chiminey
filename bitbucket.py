# Deploy Generic Nectar node

# Install required dependencies (e.g., Fortran on VM)

# Transfer program source or binary to node and install

# Get input data from command line or from input files or directories

# Transfer any input files/directores to node using SFTP/SCP

# Run the program on the node.

# Retrieve the data from the node back to the client

# Terminate the instance.


# We might want to organise a node to be run multiple times with different parameters, rather than deploying
# and destroying each time.  This could be an extension if we get time.
